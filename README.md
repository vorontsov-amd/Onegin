# Onegin

Onegin is a C program that sorts the file line by line alphabetically from the beginning of the line and from the end of the line, while ignoring any non-alphabetic characters. The sorted output is written to a new file. 

## Usage

The program can be compiled and run on any system that has a C++ compiler installed. 

### Compiling

To compile the program, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will create an executable file named `FileSort`.

### Running

To run the program, use the following command:

```
./onegin [input_file] [output_file]
```

Replace `[input_file]` with the path to the file that you want to sort, and `[output_file]` with the path to the file where you want to save the sorted output.
