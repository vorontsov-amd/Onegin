     He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     He drained his glass down to the end
     Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
     He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
     He followed them without illusion,
     He found them in some old collection,
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
     He got so used to this immersion,
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
     He opens up a door. What's that
     Herder, and even at times a Russian --
     He reads to Olga on occasion,

     Her passion burns with stronger powder
     Her tender touch had never fingered
     He's always with her: either seated
     He sang of grief and parting-time,
     He sang of love, to love subjected,

     He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping

     He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     He sweetened up with fancy's icing

     He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
     He was a good and simple barin;6
     He was convinced, a kindred creature
     He was no fool; appreciated

     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;

     In days of carefree aspirations,
     In duels a pedantic don,
     I need to rest from all this rhyme:
     I never lived or wrote for praise;

     She entered the deserted yard.
     She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
     She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
     She hates a friendly voice's sound,
     She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
     ``She knows you?'' ``Why, we lived next door.''
     She'll not see him, her obligation
     She looked across, felt in her heart
     She looks: forgotten past all chalking
     She loved the balcony, the session
     She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
     She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
     She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
     She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
     She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
     She sits down by the window-sill.
     She sits with Nina8 at a table --
     ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
     ``She's not in love?'' ``There's no one, ever.
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     She struck one as the incarnation --
     She wanders on without direction.
     She was alone, lit by the moon.
     She was like him and always sported
     ``She was the one who looked as still
     She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
     Shishkov,6 forgive me: I don't know
     Shot through below the chest -- and streaming
     Should your perfections be expended
     Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
     Sign of the urge for domination:
     Silence was everywhere enthralling;
     Since dawn, whole families have been driving
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted
     Since then Martin Zad√©ka's spell
     Since when is this?'' ``Two years or more.''
     ``Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage
     Smiling through sleep, nature is meeting
     So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply
     So a disabled soldier-man,
     So down came Tanya, hardly daring
     Softly the door is opened, enter
     So glut yourselves until you're sated
     ``So let it be! for you to keep
     So let me with a kind expression
     So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
     Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
     Some neighbours there have come together;
     Sometimes a landscape's represented,
     Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     So now be off to Neva's brink,
     So she was called Tatyana. Truly
     So the poor butterfly will quiver
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     So to his wife for presentation

     So went his sermon. Almost dying,
     So you, inspired Yaz√Ωkov,4 sobbing
     Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
     Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
     Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
          Still for ever, fare thee well.
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.
     Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
     Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
     Such feckless passion -- as I live,
     Such were a young rake's meditations --
     Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted

     Tanya begins to understand
     Tanya comes to in utter fright...
     Tanya is gripped. No comment's made
     Tanya looks on; her own indictment
     Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
     Tanya pursued them with her gaze...
     Tanya's distress had risked detection
     ``Tanya's no child -- it's past a joke,''
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.
     Tanya to all her kin. My sorrow
     Tanya today goes hurrying out
     Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
     Tatyana asked. The children all
     Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
     Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
     Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.
     Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
     Tatyana groaned above the tide;
     Tatyana had a changeling look
     Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
     Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
     Tatyana hears but takes no part;
     Tatyana, hiding her condition,
     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana in a deep emotion
     Tatyana in low-cut attire
     Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
     Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
     Tatyana listened with vexation
     Tatyana, lonely heroine,
     Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
     Tatyana looks with pulses racing
     Tatyana lowered her regard
     Tatyana never knew the attraction
     Tatyana now need wait no longer.
     Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
     Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
        Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
     Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
     Tatyana sees with trepidation
     Tatyana shared with full conviction
     Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
     Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
     Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
     Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
     Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
     Tatyana's love is no by-play,
     Tatyana's name day celebration.
     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     Tatyana struggles to run out --
     Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
     Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
     Tatyana went with them, and sped
     ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
     ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
     Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
     That isn't our immediate worry:
     That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
     That's when I'll sit down to compose
     That year the season was belated
     The Larins kept the old tradition:
     ``The Lord God be with you, my daughter!''
        The Song of the Girls
     The World found this enough to treat
     The arbitrary rules of passion
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
     The bearded outrider is sitting
     The better to dispel her sorrow
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
     The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
     The ch√¢teau was of a construction
     The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
     The comrade of so many days,
     The crush, the heat, as music blares,
     The darkness thins away; but still
     The days flew past; by now the season
     ``The elegy's just vain protesting,
     The evening passes, and meanwhile
     The fields are dark, since evening came.
     The fire was dying; cinders faintly
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     The hall is full of noise and hustle,
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     The hearth was low beyond all stoking.
     The horses, as they sense the dead,
     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
     The illness with which he'd been smitten
     The invalid's glad salutation,
     Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
     Their talk, so sound on every matter,
     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     The lady of the house has fled.
     The manor house, in deep seclusion,
     ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,
     ``The morning star will soon be shining,
     Then Tanya hears of the decision.
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;
     Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
     Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     Then gradually upon sensation,
     The night has many stars that glitter,
     Then in return for all this twaddle,
     ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
     The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
     Then our Automedons are flashing,
     Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
     ``Then send your grandson with this letter
     Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
     Then what resulted from the meeting?
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     The old dame had no thought of scouring
     The olden days, I want to hear...''
     ``The one you love's the younger daughter?''
     ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
     The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
     The ploughman there delights to doze,
     The poet's dead... already though
     The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
     The protocol is all one wishes:
     There came a murmur, for a fleeting
     ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
     There many pages keep the impression
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     There's din of parting now that rages,
     There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
     There's powdery snow up to her knees;
     There's vacancies in plenty there.''
     There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
     There was -- --,10 so notorious
     There was a period when cold-blooded
     There was a pine-branch downward straying
     There, with epigrammatic neatness,
     There you're entirely sure of finding
     The rustic sage, in that apartment,
     These days I'm finding even gladness,
     These figures from the world of seeming,
     The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
     The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
     The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     The two old ladies kiss and cry;
     The vote was passed without demur.
     The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
     The yard was bursting with dependants;
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     The years incline to gloom and prosing,
     The years would pass; no longer youthful,
     They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
     They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
     They should be forced to read in Russian,
     They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
     They take her too to the Assembly.
     They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
     They will receive us with delight.''
     This dear, still world I must forswear
     ``This is Vladimir Lensky's grave
     ``This time I think you've been reduced to

     Today it's turn and turn about.
     Today... the sad memorial's lonely,
     To face society's derision
     To harmless idleness devoted,
          To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.

     a ball in Petersburg; but fun
     a bit provincial and affected,
     a blank default would suit me better.
     a blessing from its blasts and rages,
     a block of snow will slip and tumble.
     a book of household calculations,
     about one thing, till our next meeting.
     about them -- nineteen to the dozen --
     about what's buried in the past:
     above a stream the moon had lighted.
     above the dust of his remains
     above the water started tracing
     a brook flows through a grove of lime.
     absorbed me in the recollection
     a calculation past despising --
     a carving-knife -- and in the tangle

     across green meadows, dilly-dally,
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     across the Baltic in exchange
     across the drift-encumbered acres,
     across the fields, round hill and rock;
     across the plain's enormous room,
     across the public's toes; he steers
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
     across the years to our own time.
     across to her consort a weary

     a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
     a far-flung traveller who was creaking
     a fashion-plate for illustrators,
     a faster, stronger pulsing start.
     a few books had escaped disgrace:
     affected pose -- and an unspeaking
     a fisher's fire. Through country gleaming
     a flimsy bridge whose every quake
     a flood on which no frosty band
     a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
     a fop, a punter on the cards,
     a free romance's far horizon,
     a frequent question: ``tell me who
     a friend of yours in his first youth
     after Saint Chariton's gone past
     after her own room, makes her fret.
     after that, supper's served, and so
     after the martyr's price it paid,
     after two minutes, off again,
     after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
     a full confession of the heart.

     against the tea's excessive sweetness,
     aged Derzh√°vin1 saw and blessed us
     a general of majestic bearing
     ages we'd never heard of love:
     a girl or two, without a smile
     a glossary of smart argot...
     a grain of gladness; tears' repression
     a grammar, a digest of fable,
     a great attraction to conversing.
     a grey-haired, perfumed exquisite,
     a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
     a group of monsters round a table,
     a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I

     a humble cross, in woodland gloom,
     a hundred times afresh distorted;
     a hybrid cross of cat and crane.
     a joker in the old tradition,
     a joking flirt, or both together,
     a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
     alarmed by my melodious lay,
     (alas, too salted); now they're bringing
     album and stays, Princess Alina,
     a liar still, Lyub√≥v Petrovna,

     all a pure maiden's love was breathing.

     allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
     allows no comfort to come through --

     all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.
     all sorts of hopeless appetites;
     all stand. He walks towards the door.
     all's well; the destined hour at last
     all that today we find absurd.
     all these are charming! but to put
     all this, at eighteen years of age,
     all was material for transcribing:
     almanacs, journals of reflection,

     alone across the fields of space,
     alone, and sunk in calculation,
     alone with him; Onegin takes her
     alone, with no adornment on;
     along Tverskaya Street already
     along the Neva in a sleigh,
     along the street lies dirty snow;
     along the street where slumber drowses,
     already high in treason's league!
     already she'd assume ill-luck.
     already silvering all the plain...
     already stirred him as they should.
     already studying to intrigue,
     already tends too much to smile
     already there she stands beside him;
     already yawned before the show,
     although it's nearly heard the knell,
     although one in no manner shares
     although there are no streets, no cards,
     always before the volume ended
     always comes back: I'll not be wedded.
     always contented with his life,
     always monotonously gay,
     a lyre, and on it perched, a dove --

     amidst the howling and the blast
     amid the deadening joys of fashion,
     a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
     a modish second-hand edition,
     a modish taste, a dowdy touch --
     among my friends, in all that crowd
     amongst devout coquettes, appalling
     amongst the crafty and small-minded,
     < amongst the soulless men of pride,
     among the guests a general dinning:
     among the guests she recognized
     among the maidens and the wives,
     among the neighbours round about.

     and my whole life has been directed

     and not because she'd once preferred
     and nothing in her look is altered:
     and nothing pierced his senses' blur.
     and not without a sigh, perforce

     and now at last he saw the World.
     and now it's Bordeaux the Judicious
     and now the crunchy snow is stripping
     and obstinate his look. But she

     and pay my debt in the same coin
     and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;

     and portents of the lunar phase.
     and prone to censure in our thought;
     and put a cross-sign on the maid.

     and read the books there on her own.

     and rest myself from earlier days.

     and satisfied with what he'd got,

     and set on hating the coquette,
     and sets her gently on the floor.
     and she, submissively, inertly --
     and should have played a different part:
     and shout, and make room for the pair.
     and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
     and sideways her poor head is stooping.
     and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
     and silently he hung his head.
     and sink to prose's humble level:
     and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful
     and sleeping sounder than a rock.
     and slowly day begins to climb.
     and so, before the world of learning,
     and so he lacks the strength to mention
     and so in the salons could make
     and so in winter-fields will shiver
     and some were even testifying
     and soon his travels had begun,
     and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
     and soon they bring her... a guitar
     and soon will day's bright tune be played;
     and so the harmless chat progresses
     and so your faithfullest supporter
     and stately periwigs, their fame.

     and, still transparent to the view,
     and still within, behind the veil
     and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
     and stoves with tiles of various hue.
     and strip the forest round about.
     and swaggers in a red calpack;
     and swarming in his inmost soul.
     and take due warning from my speech.
     and taken by the French -- some prize! --
     and tea and supper; there's an inner
     and teaching children how to spell.
     and tears were drowning her regard.
     and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
     and tedious means to festive ends.
     and telling trochee from iambic
     and tell of children's plighted playing
     and than these letters, and these tears.
     and that embittered mind which boils
     and the Skot√≠nins, grizzled sages,
     and the blancmanger, then a fleet
     and the churchyard where, new-erected,
     and the deep-throated billows' choric
     and the derivative Knyazhn√≠n:8
     and theirs was the poetic flame
     and the majestic, antlered royal,
     and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.
     and then concludes: she loves him yet!
     and then, indoors the livelong day,
     and then it's tea that comes to mention,
     and then old cousin Pelag√©ya
     and then sat silent all the way.
     and then, with an enchanting grace,
     and the poet, without a sound,
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     and there a tombstone says its word
     and there, beneath your noonday sky,
     and there, love's protestations, binding

     and though my muse may be capricious,
     and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
     and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
     and though to do so would be daring,
     and thoughts of her were what inspired him
     and thus our race, so fluctuating,

     and to it, with a grave import,
     and took a mortgage on his land.
     and took two Petriads in calf,

     and to the vision of those mortal
     and trails alone around the wood.''
     and trains a mirror till it faces
     and trembles like a hunted fawn.
     and tried to write, but a hard session
     and truffles, which have ever been
     and underneath her downy pillow
     and, under, ``toute √† vous Annette'';
     and up the rustling curtain crawls.
     and useful goods of every kind.
     and volume three of Marmontel.
     and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
     and walk, and breathe, before I tell
     and warmed the Chinese teapot; flowing
     and washed its face, to her brought word
     and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.
     and watched a different world unroll.
     and watch him stubbornly bring low
     and watch your daughters closer yet,
     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
     and when, by misty moon, the east
     and when its waters were not showing,
     and, when one's least prepared for it
     and where Terpsichore alone
     and where Thalia, gently napping,
     and where had he arrived from, not
     and where he'd silently agreed.
     and where is love's tempestuous yearning,
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     and where's her sister now? and where,
     and where the husband, recognizing
     and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
     and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
     and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
     and whist, that's now so keenly f√™ted --
     and with a halting, trembling gait
     and with a sigh I now admit
     and with a yawn took up his pen,
     and with his dinner, and his wife.
     and, with it, forced renown to come --
     and with its feeble glow outlining
     and, with my Eugene, so have I.
     and with no post, no work, no wife,
     and with the decorous throng to follow
     and wore his dressing-gown to dine.
     and wrecked the flooring-boards for good;
     and yawn in silence at the stage
     and yet a distant admonition
     and yet by Vergil or Racine
     and yet in her you'd not detect --
     and yet inseparably present,
     and yet in vain ennui I squander
     and yet so light. All that is real
     and yet your honour is my gage
     and your alas-ing and alack-ing
     and your sincerity of thought
     an elegy to her address,
     an eloquence of fevered strength,
     an idle monk in glum seclusion,
     a nightingale, in forest gloom,
     an inn at each stage of the route.
     an ode in twenty-five cantos.
     an offering ready for the ground.
     an old man saw her as she came,
     a note from Lensky; in between
     another, a more chilling dream,
     another, and his memory's fled
     another bard1 in exaltation
     another, freakish one, who stays
     another of the ball-dictators,
     another's grin was sly and shifty,
     another's joy, another's breast,
     a novel graced with such a name.
     a novel in Lafontaine's8 manner...
     a novel on the established line
     a novel, vague and superficial,
     anticipates a swim, in stead
     an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
     any Madonna by Van Dyck:
     a park, enormous and neglected,
     a parodistic raree-show?
     apartment where a double glaze
     a passer-by; and on tiptoe
     a patriot, a cosmopolite,
     a place for rest. Eugene alone
     a plain, unceremonious troop,
     a poet, and a Kantian sage.
     a portrait with a charming touch;
     appears offensive or amusing
     approaches Olga; Lensky's signed
     a pretty girl exactly like
     a quilted chamber-robe and cap.
     a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
     a rambling walk beside my lake,
     arch-commentator of the dream.
     arch-rake, pothouse tribune-persona,
     are almost bursting; she's quite ready,
     are bound, by every virtuous wife,
     are coloured in a single tone,
     a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
     are entered here, in friendship's gage,
     are here untouched by fashion's reign,
     are just as nimble as their feet.
     are old times, and the servants' hall.
     a rest from toil and all its aches,
     a restless urge for change of place
     are treated to the fullest rigour
     are we recalled to grief still burning
     a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...
     a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,
     a rooster head, and on the twitch
     around Priam the much-respected,
     around her neck, or when for her
     arrested by the sheer perfection
     arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,
     as I have... learn from my belief
     as I recall a bygone age?
     (as I've so oft in jest related)?
     as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,
     as all things did, to bore him; homing,
     as at a censure that was hard.
     a saucy kib√≠tka is slicing
     as battles go, I've not begun;
     as bonneted Academician
     as by the shortest way they flew,
     a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...
     as did the general at her side.
     a secret truth, and at our cost
     a seedling fallen in the earth.
     as fast as post-horses could go,
     as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,
     as files, and scissors straight and curving,
     as fresh as ever, for its graces
     as from their luscious hive go tumbling
     as gage of all things that were good,
     as gay as morning and as clear,
     a shadow, null and meaningless,
     a shambling hoof along the way;
     a sham that trustful souls work out;
     a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
     as he descended to the grave.
     as helpmeet in my sad existence,
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
     as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
     as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     as if spellbound, Tatyana stands.

``for reasons of censorship'' because, as Nabokov explains, ``tsars were not

     heartfelt, imploring, touching trash
     heaven's will -- for you I'm set apart;
     he carries her inside the door
     he changed the corv√©e of tradition
     he charged three roubles and a half,
     he consecrated to my keeping?...
     he danced attendance with the best;
     ``he dandled me as a small boy.

     he failed to join that sharp profession
     he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
     he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
     he fled from their resounding chatter!
     he found Tatyana so attractive,
     he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
     he found too much that he regretted:
     he gazed out on the threatening glow.
     he goes ahead and parts the motley
     he had conveyed some moral teaching,
     he had the talent of saluting
     he has to bring the battle-case.
     he heard in stillness and in din
     he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
     he informed this envoy diplomatic
     he killed eight years in such a style,
     he knew too well that sort of scene.
     he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
     held in constraint by pity's touch:
     he leaves a tender verse behind,
     he leaves one morning the hermetic
     he leaves the house, calls for his horse
     he'll charm you with his fine invention,
     he'll spend before the looking-glass,
     hell's terrifying imprecation:
     he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire
     he looks, and sees the hour of day --
     he looks, in sweet irresolution,
     he loves you... like your kith and kin!
     helping the poor, or while I mended
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     henceforth in front of you I weep,

     her bosom heaves, her cheeks are staring
     her bow, as calm and as restrained.

     her darling foot of its wet shoe,
     her discomposure, her confusion,
     her drops of tears, and seated there,

     he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
     he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
     he really forced one to admire him --

     hereditary foes they seem,
     here's Petushk√≥v, the local fop;
     here's boredom, madness or pretence,

     here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
     he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
     here there's no conscience, here no sense;
     her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
     her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.
     her feelings were far more inclined --
     her fingers shake, she doesn't dare
     her full account of voiceless pain?
     her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
     her golden earrings off and whipping;
     her grief, and nearly ran away.
     her handkerchief has fallen too;
     her hands affectionately pressed;
     her head in modesty cast down,
     her heartache, did it long compel her,
     her heart had long been overrun:
     her heart had spoken, free as air,
     her heart speaks to her even louder
     her husband's or the world's attention...
     her journey home is overdue.
     her kindness, move Tatyana; yet
     her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
     her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
     her love obeys the laws of feeling,
     her manner is no less contained;
     her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
     her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!
     her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
     her path a hare in headlong flight
     her progress at the masquerade.
     her sacred store of bliss and weeping
     her seal with its engraven crest.
     her secret work of magic suasion!
     herself not knowing how or why)
     her soul's attention; just behind her
     her soul was waiting... for someone.
     her steppeland charms into a rout.3
     her thoughts away, knew how to lavish
     her to the altar and the crown.
     her way; she passed, then as she walked
     her worth (but anathematising

     he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --

     he saw that, as in cities, here
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     he's called you out -- say, in your soul
     he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     he sends a letter, penned with passion.
     he sends, a second, then a third.
     he's first to toast her in the bowl,
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     he should have settled for disarming
     he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
     he's left sad footprints on the ground.
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     he's moved... you see him from the side.''
     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
     he's racing millward like a bird.
     he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
     he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
     he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
     he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
     he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
     he strove to achieve the appropriation
     he struggled to bite back the chilling
     he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,
     he takes her to a chair, beginning
     he trembles, knows not what to tell;
     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
     he warns his man for duty, stressing
     he was a menace, and a freak.
     he was a poet in his day.
     he watched the guests and, as he dined,
     he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
     he who has cooled down love with parting,
     he would have found a normal fate.
     high time he should be on his way.
     him far enough through wild and waste.

     himself just like a simple chap.
     his French valet, Guillot, is there
     his Strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
     his Sunday game of cards with me.
     his acts and words to suit our end?
     his awkwardness, he's hardly said
     his beasts outdoors at dawn, nor ringing
     his beefsteak with champagne, or drown
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     his children and his faithful wife,
     his choice could shock or might offend;
     his collar in its beaver braiding
     his conscience's record, and so
     his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
     his destiny) without a smile
     his dreams, while she whom they're about,
     his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --
     his elegies flow like a brook.
     his epigrams topped up with bile.
     his foolish face; more pleasant yet
     his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
     his gaze at Tatyana alone --
     his head upon her shoulder... blaze
     his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
     his hours to dreaming them away:
     his housekeeper and her department
     his humbly suppliant approach,
     his illness lends him courage and
     his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
     his life till dawn's already making,
     his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission
     his mind, in judgement still unsteady,
     his mind's eye focused on the hinted
     his mind, so cold and so precise.
     his mother taps the window-pane.
     his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
     his nature would be changed and steadied,
     his neighbour entered at a rush
     his news has set the party humming!
     his parents' patriarchal dust
     his pistols, laid them in their case,
     his pup to grace the sledge, while he
     his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
     his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;
     his song was limpid in its tune
     his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
     his soul to a delicious rapture
     his soul with murmurs of distress.
     his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
     his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
     his style breathed love, and not the gibing
     his sweetheart faithful to her grief.
     his tale of youthful love, narrated
     his tea with rum quite left behind,
     his thoughts were on a distant goal:
     his thrusting horns, and as he passes
     his transports, and the marriage-bed
     his virulence that made you smile,
     his weary head, and softly drooping
     his wit, according to the rules
     his young heyday's supreme employment,

     hope that he's had no time to fashion
     how I interpret this expression:
     how are your kith and kin today?
     how bold or bashful there, and here
     how brilliant with its instant tear!
     how dull to work for the correction
     how envious was I of the waves
     however much her soul has faltered,
     however scarlet; free from error
     however strongly she has been
     how fearful, too, is my obsession
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
     how many follies were engendered;
     how many lines of verse, and themes
     how pleasantly the stages pass.
     how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
     how sad the scar of passion's knife:
     how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
     how soon the bounds of rank and station
     how they remind me of your stem,
     how to engage in talk that drew
     how well he knew the way to hurt --
     how well she'd studied her new role!

     if I had power to choose your fashion --
     if I, like you, had been a bard.
     if I show wit in jesting thus.
     if her cross mood was at its worst --
     if, motionless, no life appearing,
     if not slow-witted, might have known.
     if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
     if you'd still been with me, dear friend,

     impatient, hatred flaming high;
     impatiently on the mill-dam,
     importune with my lyre, whenever
     in Adam Smith was his diploma;
     in Lyc√©e gardens long ago,
     in Olga everything expresses --
in Russia among the common people.'' Pushkin's note.
     in Russian never found expression,
     in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
     in albums, blunted the censorious
     in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,
     in all the world could take my heart!
     in a melodious, flute-like tone.
     in any picture of this kind:
     in a peaked cap, all dust and fluff, --
     in a still stream that never dries.
     in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
     in boxes or the rows of stalls.
     in britzkas, kib√≠tkas and sleighs.
     in casual letters of confession --
     incendiary looks are slinking,
     in corners whispering girls concur;
     in country towns and suchlike places
     in dark attire the new-born day.
     in darkest forest depths and drowned
     in darkness in her room, or treated
     in deep anxiety of mind.
     in deepest grasses, quite alone,
     in deepest thought at the chess-board
     in dreams and cards and their prediction,
     in dream toward the woods and plains,
     in due succession; hers is lifted
     in empty deeds and futile toils.
     in everything she sees there's not
     inexorably wed to duty,
     in fact a thorough fop, no less.
     in fact by some quite different thought.
     in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
     in fashion's din, at still of night,
     in fashion that's half-glad, half-anguished:
     in father's or old uncle's book,
     in first place -- listen, am I right? --
     in flannel, and an old fur cap.
     in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:
     in friendly gatherings where I read,
     in front of you, on every hand,
     in frosted bottle, for the poet
     ingenious London has been sending
     in goods and fame!'' But the sad-sounding
     in gossip's rambling and discursion
     in grief that nothing else could mend;
     inherited from earlier days
     in her once more has come alive.
     in her own home. She never took
     in her torn heart -- a fickle gleam;
     in his defence, and smash it up;
     in his first dream of passion's fruit,
     in his small shack, will listen well
     in indescribable elation,
     in indolence and in rampageous
     in ink with colour-wash above;
     in limpid verse that lives and gleams.
     in lives that were just dawning then.
     in loaded carriages, migrate,
     in manifesting, as he could,
     in midst of a poetic dream,
     in midst of trouble, storm or din.
     in morning time he'd read a book...

     in our first ages), from no place
     in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,
     in, past concierge, up marble stair
     in play with her obedient doll
     in question, gossip, news and tale,
     in quiet flood. A beetle whirred.
     in quilted coat, where rays were gleaming
     in quilted dressing-gown adorned,
     in rose-trimmed bonnets, but malicious;
     in rural calm's most secret place!
     in secret judgement what he'd done,
     in sensible old-fashioned style.
     in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash.
     in showing how to tell apart
     inside a pocket Triquet nurses,
     inside the Larins' house fell mute.
     in sighs and boredom and deceits
     in silence all day she'd remain
     in simple but sublime reflection,
     insists, when the mazurka ends,
     in sledded coaches and coup√©s,
     in solitude, as at the start
     inspires your lute to sounds of sighing?
     installed in me a different devil,
     in stars upon the river-brink.
     instead the chance to get acquainted
     in sultry sleep, in lonely bed,
     in taffeta of mourning black.
     in talk, so fruitless and so stale,
     in tears and violent tossing vented
     interior d√©cor in the end
     in terms of poetry or passion --
     in terms where not a word was spared:
     in that new couch, no sleep for certain;
     in that one sound, for Russian hearts!
     in the deep stillness of the night,
     in the expression of its being,
     in the far backwoods' deepest heart,
     in the full beauty of its frown;
     in their gay glass, the borrowed light
     in the mazurka he was light,
     (in the romantic style, we say,
     in the salon new faces meet,
     in the saloon, brocade-surrounded,
     in these last years all mixed and fluttered.

     in time (to quote the calculation

     into a modish tyrant's keeping
     into an unbecoming brawl.
     into a small quit-rent -- and got
     into his look, the exhibition
     into the all√©e, face to face,
     into the cups its darkling stream --
     into the fields, surveys the morning,
     into the mud, a drunken goner,
     into the pan. Securely gripping,
     into the social whirlabout;
     into the tomb's mysterious shade;
     into the tomb's wide open portals,
     in triumph you'll see winter through!
     in twilight of all√©es of lime.
     in unison repeat the cry:
     in untold beauty close at hand.

     in which his hero's mould was cast.
     in which our hero used to dwell.
     in which so lately it abounded
     in which the rhymester-man-of-fashion
     in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
     in winter was her heart's delight.
     in you a tender pulse was beating,
     in your cal√®che of foreign cast --
     in your pursuit I've come to know it:
     is ``Kit''3 to every maiden's ear.
     is a compulsive bore by reason
     is agony, if I may speak,
     is all those stubborn lips desire!
     is brought to table at full speed.
     is calling us, for ever calling --
     is dear to me, for it has brought
     is death, not pain. So gently gliding
     is deep in love, just like a boy;
     is dimmed. Down there the valley soon
     is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?
     is either the distrait Vampire,

     is firmly cast. I don't know whether
     is forced to crucify himself,
     is graven on that face of stone.
     is he who's never felt its will,
     is in voluptuous languor dressed,
     is in your poetry enshrined?''
     is it not true that Russian speech,
     is it that she, poor simple sweet,
     is known today; only a soul
     is lost in obstinate reflection;
     is mincing manners -- nothing more.
     is needed, nothing's left to tell.
     is on his feet -- in utter stillness
     is only Olga: he relieves
     is out of fashion in our time.
     is represented rather truly,
     is sad old moon's... Hark! snow is creaking...
     is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
     is softly, indolently sleeping,
     is that my feet lack strength to go
     is there to lisp its pack of lies.
     is the supreme reward. Precisely,
     is this -- one sees from here the party:
     is this the man that you were seeking?
     is this then what you can't forgive?
     is this the riddle's missing clue?
     is tinsel on a life I hate;
     is where old master took up station,
     is with dull trash that can't cohere:
     is yawned away with friends and wife
it.
     it blabs, and spills them in its tracks.
     it brought back Tanya from her trance.
     it can't be youth's distemper -- love?
     it frankly, I'm a firm adorer
     it had its epigram-potential7...
     it had no sparkle of sensation,
     it held me captive; tit for tat,
     it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain
     it lacked, of course, poetic heart,
     it led him, in these early sessions,
     it mastered him in slow gradation;
     it may be late, but it's a start.
     it melts, away it rushes, racing
     it needs no gold if a supply
     (it's all the same -- you well correct us),
     it's also true, in battle's rapture,
     its barely noticeable stream.
     its due oblivion, in the hush
     it's easy, without too much fooling,
     its echoes, its belated urging,
     ``it seems that he forgot us all.''
     its furrow through the powdery icing;
     its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
     its grip on him, forgot to count
     it's hidden deep in gloom and dust.
     its image, then to swoon before
     it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
     it's like a vanishing newcomer --
     it's my profession; he was wearing --
     its natural right to rave and flare.
     its newness with our faded days,
     it's new to us, beyond gainsaying;
     it's not in him to bring me bliss.''
     its nullity I've always hated,
     its own perfection everywhere,
     its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
     its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
     ``it's time!'' and freedom hears my hail.
     it stirs her drooping soul to bound
     it stood, defiant of destruction
     its views, its passions, or its cares!
     its wayward tricks, its violent surging,
     its winds had blown him far off course.
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
     it's yes or no, but never sir.''
     it touched with reverie her leisure,
     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abb√©.
     it was quite torn in half and breaking.
     it was that he'd been truly stirred,
     it will be our descendants who
     it would be painful to depart
     jaws masticate as minutes pass:
     jealously, shyly, I've imported
     jealousy's flame, to light desire;
     jointly would tread life's humble way!
     just as she'd always been, she tripped
     just as the Poet15 paints himself.
     just at this crisis of his gale,
     just like a casual guest who might
     just like a shadow, or a wife.
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
     just look, and never mind the chatter...
     just now of wrestling with his shade,

     like Regulus, that god of honour,
     like a drunk traveller in a shelter,
     like a majestic moon, she drives
     like a sweet child. She'll never say:
     like a true friend, to speak my name.
     like fields in spring when storms arrive.
     like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
     like foliage in the rotting fall.
     like irksome phantoms, null as zero.
     like mindless youth, the waltz goes by
     like native idiom from their lips?

     of reason's icy intimations,
     of recompense beyond endurance,
     of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
     of ruts that grace our fatherland.
     of secret pain... but it's now rated
     of secrets, like a friend but dearer,

     of sense and judgement. For his part
     of sighs, and compliments, and fire;
     of simple product supplements it.
     of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
     of social buzz and modish riot,
     of solitude, and peace abiding!

     such stubborn brain, and vivid will,
     suddenly lowering eyes that languish,

     summits of aspen, birch and lime,

     surer than friendship or than kin,
     suspecting wonders would come out.

     swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina,
     swaying the artless, waiting on
     sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
     sweet old tradition was preserved:
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     sweet words by which her pain was banned --
     swiftly decayed beyond recall
     take any novel, clearly traced
     take leave of my lightheaded youth!
     taken the saucers in their grip,
     taken your place, though not your throne?
     takes up an hour or two; at last
     take wing on spite; that serious men
     talk that might turn a young girl's head)
     terse words or crosses in the book,
     than households where the wife must moan
     thank God, he had no inclination
     thank him by curtseying to the dust;
     thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
     thank you for suffering and its joys,
     thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
     than most. Evgeny, though he knew
     than this humiliating passion
     than what our sorrowing rhymesters do?
     that I'm just longing to indite --
     that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
     that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
     that Menelaus was quite right --
     that alien scene must I now turn
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     that ardent youth entirely lacks;
     that, artless, and without concealing,
     that corps of social legislation --
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     that even so my wretched style
     that fell, and then began to shiver,
     that fiery souls' headstrong enthusing
     that fills him and in which he lives.
     that fired his soul, to burn the same;
     that, for all this, my shame's report
     that from the backdoor he'd be leaving
     that generations of new beauties,
     (that half-pay archivist); and bounding
     that he's not honest past all question.''
     that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
     that inexperience leads to grief.''
     that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
     that king of the satiric scene,
     that lady the hostess was greeting,
     that lady whose engaging charm
     that languid beauty, listens nicely --
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     that lives, and glitters, and endears,
     that marble Nina's proved unable
     that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
     that mediocre dress alone
     that modish rings were still a-buying.
     that moment, of a luscious pie
     that night, in secret, set for two;
     that not a syllable be uttered
     that nubile maid of riper age,
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     that one be shot just anyhow --
     that on the world's staircase there waited
     that poison brew; and in your mind
     that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
     that queen of secrets and of sighing.
     that raves with poetry can ever
     that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
     that sat above the stove and purred
     that self-same evening where he'd go.
     that she's ``ideal'', begins preparing
     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     that somehow that same day we'll meet...
     that soul without a moral tie,
     that spring with me has had its fill
     that's the morass, I beg you note,
     that's the refrain that you should sing,
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     that strikes him with such force and meaning?
     that's where my years of youth were spent.
     that table where the lamp has languished,
     that there be just one voice which came,
     < that there existed, for the indulgence
     that there his friend Kav√©rin's5 waiting;
     that thievish mouths cannot consume
     that this of all things for a swain
     that, though polite, was clear as ice.
     that verse will turn to useful duties;
     that virgin dream and its confession
     that visitors must be expected.
     that was less clever still by half.
     that we enjoy equating chatter
     that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
     that wit embarrasses the dull;
     that with him to the trysting-place
     that world where every man's a critic
     that your proud glance is sure to take!
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
     the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
     the Lord have mercy on us all!
     the Major's here: he's all the rage
     the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
the Neva.''
     the Russian N, like N in French;
     the Russian for le comme il faut.
     the abstracted poet would bring forth
     the album of a country miss
     the all√©e to the lake, the copse;
     the altar flame's extinguished now.
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the answer's past all human viewing,
     the ardent author of the past
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
     the bear has raised her in his paws;
     the bear let out a roar, and held
     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
     the best revenge one could desire.
     the big room, further, not a cat.
     the blaze of candles, and the trembly
     the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
     the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
     the blood came smoking from the wound.
     the blood within my withered heart,
     the bloom has withered on the bough;
     the books then underwent inspection...
     the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the branches all are weighted down
     the branches of the oak with flock;
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     the cabinet behind the door
     the carriage of the newly-wed.
     the charge that poets are unable
     the charm of what was grave and plain.
     the child prepares for protocol --
     the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues
     the circumstances of his capture
     the clamorous honking geese began
     the climacteric of our life,
     the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
     the coach has reached its destination;
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the cold perfection of the sky,
     the cooks prepare the midday meal;
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the country cottages and hovels,
     the country's pretty stupid here!
     the crash of plates and knives is blended
     the crown of marriage was projected
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the cunning prisoner can quite well
     the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
     the darling sex is light as down.
     the days grew shorter, in the glade
     the days that doom has measured out.
     the deeper in the wood, the more
     the doorway opened wide to meet her,
     the downy woods are greener-tinted;
     the draught whose blessings are agreed,
     the driver sits and cuts a dash
     the eager players are enrolled --
     the earlier griefs are what I miss.
     the early pealing of the bells
     the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
     the easier they become to charm,
     the elegy, grown paralytic,
     the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
     the entire story of your fate.
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
     the faces met with everywhere;
     the fateful diet; by depression
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     the festal name day has begun.
     the first will never find fruition,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the fleeting tenderness that stole
     the fleeting works of my creation,
     the flickering tones of dress and speech,
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
     the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
     the fools who sparkle far and wide,6
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the foreign words a maiden's passion
     the friends' salute she never hears
     the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
     the full fruit of her heart's desire;
     the funeral monument explains:
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
     the gift of recognizing what
     the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
     the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
     the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,
     the grand barouche is on its way.
     the grand monde finds it out of place.
     the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
     the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
     the hall's without a living creature,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     the happenings of the previous night;
     the hare who from afar has seen
     the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
     the headpiece-text is thus indited --
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     the heart and all its fragile dreams.
     the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the heavenly lights in glorious quire
     the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
     the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
     the horrid nightmare must portend
     the horror of disgrace and crime,
     the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the hostess cries and, moving fast,
     the hour was late. And now from aching
     the household boys in noisy rout;
     the hunter in the wood will swear
     the idol that she'll most admire
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     the imperturbable princess.
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     the inevitable silly asses,
     the infant year with cheerful greeting:
     the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
     their breed would (some years after this)
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
     their guests, for all they ate and drank,
     their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
     their hand to grapple slander's cup,
     their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
     their journey took them a full week.
     their joyous way across the ice;
     their looks and language in deceit
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     their masters' berries undetected
     the iron figure3 on the table,
     their southward flight: one saw approaching
     their table, and their hours of leisure?
     their tendency to call, and sit.
     their unattractive t√™te-√†-t√™te;
     the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
     the jams appear in little dishes;
     the joys of youth, that festal cup,
     the jug of bilberry wine is seen.1
     the keys that opened up the hall.
     the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     the latest fashions of the town;
     the laurel in the old man's crown!
     the leather rein, to learn the tale,
     the legatee of his relations --
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     the letter trembles in her grip;
     the level tenor of his going,
     the lies that in the press run rife,
     the linen stretched on the tambour.
     the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
     the lover of Julie Wolmar,3
     the lucky bard, and as he dozed
     the lust for blood drew them apart?
     the magic voices of your stream,
     the maidens all are slumbering deep.
     ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''
     the man of honour and of sense.
     the man of reverie and reflection,
     the man she feared and idolized --
     the man who laid her brother low.
     the marriage plans were all exact
     the matchwood chatters as it lights.
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the men confront them, face to face:
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     themes popular or idealistic,
     the millions of two-legged creation
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the modesty of her condition,
     the modish Record Office clerks
     the moon; but in the darkened glass
     the moon in its azure of air.
     the morning after, a surprise
     the morning light no longer lingers,
     the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
     the murmuring Nereids recite,
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     then I'd have looked for you alone
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     then, country evening fast arriving,
     then dress...
     the needle, never had she lingered
     the neighbour... you must tell the brat
     the new ballet he should be at.
     the new moon, horned, on her left side,
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     then he began to talk once more
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     then he presents her with the scroll.
     the nightingale's begun to sing.
     the nightly luminaries climb.
     then in the study's quiet setting,
     then know that your reproving finger,
     then later slyly he'd revile them
     then liking grew, then every day
     then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
     the noise their rustic wheels projected --
     then, on the last page, the suggestion:
     then on the leaves of recollection,
     then quickly something changed all this:
     then quietly at last says she:
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     then to the altar, to be crowned.
     the occupations of the morning.
     the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
     the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
     the one who killed the youthful poet?''
     the only face to shake and pass
     the other, jugs of applejack,
     the pages of some dull review,
     the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     the peaceful Muses' devotee,
     the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
     the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
     the poet's heart found full expression,
     the poet's only theme is ``I.''
     the poet struck down by his friend!
     the potholes make the coach unsteady.
     the prejudices of the ages,
     the prince bring up his own relation
     the prince looks at him, and replies:
     the programme of his daily round.
     the quintessential reaction
     there —Åzerov8 shared the unwilling
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     (the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies:
     there any friend of harmless pleasure
     there caustic Shakhovsk√≥y8 came in
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     the regimental band is coming,
the relative merits of the classic ode and the romantic elegy.
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     there never fails a kindly greeting,
     there's a small window shining in it,
     there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there's no absurdity as such,
     there's no ignoble tale that seems
     there's not a word she's understood;
     there's nothing can employ her anguish,
     there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
     there waited for us both the malice
     there was a general furtive chatter,
     there was a softness in his glance:
     there was no trace to be detected
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     the ring of marriageable girls --
     the rogue has got a finger frozen:
     the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
     the rosy sealing-wafer's drying
     the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
     the sad beginnings of his life
     the safest place for declarations,
     the same as any other day.
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     the season which is such a bore --
     the secret of her husband's measure,
     the secrets of the grave, the pages
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     the shades of night within their keeping
     the shady wood, the talking stream;
     the shepherd, as he used to do,
     the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the simple faith of olden days
     the simple legend -- then a haze
     the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
     the sky is brilliant in its blue
     the snow from all surrounding hills;
     the sober head, detesting each
     the solitude of woods and tillage,
     the source's chattering voice is heard;
     the spring invites you to the land
     the spring of honour, and the pin
     the stars, the moon -- celestial light
     the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
     the strangeness of her habitation,
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
     the talk of guests when they appear;
     the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the thought sank in, and penetrated:
     the thoughts of my two anchorites.
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     the tighter we can stretch above them
     the time to go has long since passed
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
     the toll of those borne off by fate!
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     the total ownership of woods,
     the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
     the trail the youthful poet followed
     the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
     the two foes stand with eyes downcast.
     the uncertainties within his heart;
     the units are ourselves alone.
     the universe is all perfection;
     the unmetric verses of tradition
     the untiring city, where you've given
     the unworthy husband through depressing
     the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the utter virtue of their being,
     the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
     the valley's dark. The forest lands
     the vital force gives them the shoot
     the war, the snowfall, and his wife.
     the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
     the wild rose blooms, and in the covert
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     the wine-addict adores the cup:
     the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
     the world and all its works, she wept
     the world's √©clat, its thunder-roll,
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they all have swarmed into the hall,
     they all still keep their old impress:
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     they'd just enrage it with their dart.
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     they'd settled that some years before.
     the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
     they find her somewhat unexpected,
     they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
     they heap up silver with a spade;
     they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
     they leave their shores and fly away.
     they managed to disperse the pack.
     they met on horseback; quickly they
     they needed kvas like air; at table
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     the young hostess, towards whom each
     the youthful lover once again
     the youthful votary of rhyme
     the youth of those past days in line
     they praise the Father of the world.
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
     they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
     they rise and ripen and fall dead:
     they shared their days in deed and heart,
     they shove each plate, and every chair,
     they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
     they talk of her, of how and whether:
     they took offence at this, and broke
     they've moved around and been reseated;
     they were her only food... and so
     they while away the morning's calm.
     thickly the exclamations fly.
     thinking: he loved me, and in strife
     thirty-two steps with great precision,
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     this angel, this proud devil, tell,
     this child of luxury and delight.
     this denizen of the coulisses
     ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
     this modish whirl, this social story,
     this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
     this very day I'd gladly give,
     this was our heroes' conversation
     this was the science of that passion
     those monkeys of the good old days:
     those walks amid the gloom and calm
     those words where love, without condition,
     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
     though some support it with good grace).
     thought, day and night, and thought again
     though there he's no more to be found,
     thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
     thought them a pointless peccadillo;
     though we... don't shine in any way,
     though what's romantic here I simply
     though years ago I used to look
          thou, my Svetlana!
     threats, vows, and simulated fears,
     three carts -- traditional procession --
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     thrives to this moment, in a station
     through baseness of the soul that he,
     through distant regions of the heart...
     through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
     through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
     through it they're known to me, and kin.
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     through the back porch runs out and flies
     throw meadows into muddy rout,
     thumps as the balls are pressed inside
     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     till he at last was summoned down
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     times were, when master's least suggestion...''
     time was, in evening hours of leisure,
     time was when morning's breeze was swaying
     to A√ø's vintage in the sequel
     to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     to Moscow settled in a trice.
     to Olga's face, he whispered low

     to aim, at steady, even pace
     to all that's trivial and inane?
     to all the most adored actrices,

     to ask of you that you transcend
     to a soir√©e. ``My God! to her!...
     to battle further with my passion;
     to bee and butterfly unknown.
     to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''

     to be respected all through life:
     to be the bride I'd call my own.
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to boom, to flash across the sky,
     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
     to burn -- and then by force of reason
     to captivate, and then to fly.
     to catch the eye and to attract.
     to clasp your knees, and at your feet
     to come back to the hall alone
     to comfort her in all her woes,
     to cool my glances and my tongue,
     to crack between them; for a while
     to demonstrate some signs of reason:
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drain its beaker down, nor thought
     to drain, on credit, bottles three.
     to draw a breath, around her staring
     to dreaming given up unduly,
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to each and every raving feast
     to eat and drink, then separated

     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     to fresh grandparents every day.
     to garden walks, as arm in arm
     to gasp, and on a bench to sink.
     to gentlemen on every side
     together they arrived, and none
     to give you honest explanation.
     to happen long ago, dear readers,
     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
     to heart. And in his misted gaze
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to help her from the other side;
     to her flower-garden, to her novels, --
     to her glass porch; pursues her round
     to hide a hope, to make a show

     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to his mysterious tree the snake

     to hope that even once a week
     to horror-stories told at night
     to infuriate a clumsy foe;
     to institute a new regime.
     to it the people's blessing never

     to kissing or caressing father

     to life and hope with just a glance --
     to life grew colder than the dead.
     to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
     to lift his pistol up. A span
     to liven with a silk atour
     to look like sad romanticism.
     to meet a black monk, or if crossing
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
     to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
     to me her best in-quarto tome,
     to me so simply, with the fires
     tomorrow just like yesterday.
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     to my young days, it's time I turned
     to nobody except a wizened

     to pass for cultured in our ranks.

     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     to pine away from passion's thirst,
     to play with a dishevelled tress,
     to pranks and jokes of earlier date.

     to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
     to save the honour of our land
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to see life as a ritual play,
     to see my kin, and in the end
     to see the grave, and shed a tear.
     to see you, faithfully to follow,
     to sing of others must imply
     to sleep some black and empty dreams;
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
     to speak; believe me: of my shame
     to spoil loose paper by the ream;
     to steal away her neighbour's light
     to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;

     toward the neighbouring valley's river.

translated only the first part of the famous verse.'' Pushkin's note.

     two cupboards, one divan, a table,
     two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
     two or three novels where our later
     two pines have tangled at the root;

     until the dawn beneath her pillow.
     until the grave by your strong hand:
     until the tombstone; there one day
     until this day, a lady's love
     untirable, at sound of drum:
     untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
     untouched by trace of inhibition,
     upon her feverish tongue; the slip
     upon her lips the breathing dies,
     upon it, and with head down-bent
     upon the side of the distaff --

     up your accounts, and raging, toping,

     was brought there by a huckster who
     was by forebodings much oppressed.
     was far from happy with his role.
     was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
     was his absorption in their sense.
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     was it not you, dear apparition,
     was just created for the part.
     was one who raged and raged again,
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     was still mysterious and enticing --
     was stripped away, and mists encroaching
     was that calm brow of one who swooned.
     was the first thing that Olga said.

     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     wedlock for us would be abhorrent.
     we have to cherish and admire
     we'll draw it deeper in our net;
     we'll go with her to that delicious
     we'll keep love's price appreciating,

     we sometimes like to hear again
     we visit them, or without fail
     we weep for the young lover's end,
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     what London calls, with humble duty
     what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
     what can one do? as said above,
     what dream accounts for her distraction?
     whatever you may need, just call...
     what feelings would assume control
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     what have your wits to do with me?
what he can do.'' Nabokov.
     what held me was my predilection,
     what holds her in profound reflection,
     what is he? Just an apparition,
     what it's transported to our shore
     what kind of thought, what observation,
     what moves along the hidden ways
     what occupied his chafing powers
     what odes Vladimir might have written --
     what play will he present this week?
     what's in them? All this loud parading,
     what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
     what store of riches it imparts!
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     what was it in your heart it found
     what wings our first successes gave!
     when Br√©guet's chime is heard proclaiming
     when, from behind the doorway, hidden
     when galloping at headlong pace
     when he arrived; not in the slightest:
     when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
     when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
     when in the park, in the all√©e
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when night patrol's a perilous calling;
     when not quite eighteen years of age.
     when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
     when our sublimest aspiration,
     when shall I start on my escape?
     when suddenly I saw this treasure
     when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
     when we begin to talk of verse);
     when we see him from afar,
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
     where admonitions are pronounced,
     where are distress, commiseration?
     where are the reveries this time,
     where a sharp nail has made a dent.
          where can we find your equal?
     where civil treacheries are rife,
     where did that glum eccentric go,
     where dwelt this child of inspiration,
     where every day a bloodstained shade
     where fate had fixed our confrontation,
     where flows a little glittering brook,
     where folded arms are tightly pressed.
     where her security's complete.
     where he was master of his college,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     where in the heart of silence rang
     ``where master used to sit alone.
     where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
     where scribbling friends have interjected
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?
     where's the high aim, the ardent sense
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     where two old pinetrees stand united:
     where you were born as well, I think,
     whether from heaven or from hell,
     whether it goes careering past,
     which I myself won't praise or blame
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     which has recalled, without precision,
     which held him silently subjected,
     which, listening with some condescension,
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     which with a blush he leaves unread.
     while Petersburg's already rousing,
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
     while floors would split from crash of heel,
     while in the hut a girl is singing;
     while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
     while men, all sombre, all the same,
     while odes have high and noble aims...''
     while roar of violins contrives
     while serious topics were disputing,
     while she's from top to toe surveyed;
     whispered by heart a note addressed
     whisper of breeze announces morning,
     whisper repeated to the crone.
     whispers some ballad of the hour,
     whither does all my yearning tend?
     who all his life would garner praise
     who can combine it with the free
     who'd sit, and at the end of play
     who early died as die the brave'' --
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     whoever you may be, a friend,
     who, in good time, would calmly get
     who in the country spends her summer,
     who in the dark came flashing through
     who late at night are whirled away
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     ``who loves you more than I, let's see
     whom shall we never find a bore?
     whom thirty centuries have adored!
     who never learnt how dreamers babble;
     who never scorned the social rabble;
     who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
     whose heart experience has cooled
     whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
     whose kindly hand will ruffle down
     whose memory will preserve for me
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     who sets me snoring then and there --
     who swaggers in with the reply.
     who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
     who was it that you dreamt about?''
     ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.
     why, at the thought, my husband's mother
     why fight what's known to be decisive?
     wild as a forest deer, and fearful,

     will blossom into splendid highways:
     will disappear as fast as smoke:
     will find the ice elude his grip
     will give you a complete reply.
     will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
     will in a flash decide his lot.
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     will loyally discharge its duties,
     will reach, and past the tomb's compound
     will the benighted reason smile,
window-panes, departed  female owner (the soul being  feminine  in Russian),
     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
     wished him to come and say farewell.
     wishes his madness to the devil,
     with Eugene frozen where he stood.
     with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
     with Guillot; while pourparlers last
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
     with a Venetian maiden who
     with a blunt cue for the duration,
     with a consumption, they've relied.
     with a first click, the catch is tried.
     with all our hearts, and who require
     with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
     with an avowal just as artless;
     with an obeisance I'll hand over...
     with any torture so exquisite
     with a quick look perusing lightly
     with a small tray and a teacup.
     with balm of prayer my torn and rended
     with bended knees a windmill dances,
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     with broods of children of all ages,
     with bursts of passion from the heart,
     with care Zaretsky stows away
     with careful schemes of decoration
     with cause that I've recalled them here.
     with censure -- I've done all to earn it!
     with charming forefinger she traced
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     with cranium aching fit to split;
     with custom, love would fade away;
     with deeds; that dunces now and then
     with deep emotion looks about
     with deep emotion through and through,
     with demoiselles of riper age;
     with draughts from love's enticing flask,
     with each nuance of wintry glow:
     with every different kind of rabble...''
     with every sort of home possession:
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
     with fire from every cross of gold.
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with foppery and too much starch,
     with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
     with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     with heart that's grown unused to praise,
     with her own forests and her meads...
     with his forefathers would seem better;
     within her bosom to abate,
     with irresistible refulgence,
     with jealousy beyond all measure
     with lampions studded all about
     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
     with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
     with lively and pellucid look,
     with love and comfort in your meaning,
     with me to see an alien strand;
     with mournful sound the secret shade
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     with old Anisia. The next day
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     with our poor girl was kind and good;
     without a goal on which to fix,
     without an elegiac frill,
     without a trace of spite or plot,
     without a word Tatyana leant
     without preliminary feeler
     without surprise or rage... his laden,
     with parks and mansions, open up.
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with perturbation and with worry;
     with pleasure on his vengeful act.
     with pots and basins out of mind,
     with puzzled and confused regard...
     with recent fortune, vainly waited
     with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
     with scorn to make my world a hell.
     with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with sighs unconsciously regretful.
     with spinning noise and senseless flashing
     with storm and tumult in his head,
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     with tears, in quarters of the maids:
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     with the grand general in her wake --
     with the pink glow the snows assume
     with the resounding chime of glass.
     with the unmistakeable sideview
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
     with three roan horses in a line
     with trees decked in their silvery kit,
     with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
     with visions of enchanted night,
with which XXXII ends, is Pushkin's own contribution, a sample as it were of
     with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
     with work at home; but when he'd gone,
     with years no more to meet our gaze?
     with young Semy√≥nova,9 and there
     with your good offices, and so
     won't benefit these guts of mine.''
     won't even cross their minds by stealth...
     word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
     words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
work.
     works where contemporary man
     worthier of you in the perfection
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
     would be allied to him by fate;
     would bless the form his fortune took.
     would cause widespread remark and tattle,
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     would have been all that we required!
     would have been spared this laceration.
     would have divined the tender, shrinking
     would launch into self-sacrifice;
     would leave her dithering and tossing.
     would not have recognized again
     would on those evenings guess the fate
     would say goodbye and drive away,
     would settle, on the morrow morning,
     would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
     wronged always in disgraceful fashion --
     years back, to call up many a fable;
     yes, even there its triumph grows.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
     yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
     yet a capricious inclination,
     yet, as each rule has its exception,
     yet dared not trust what I could see.
     yet floods of talk around the town...
     yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet how I wish that I might raise
     yet people's malice and suspicion
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you acted well, that dread occasion,
     you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
     you called there twice, and since then took
     you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
     you'd not so much as know the name,
     you drink the magic draught of yearning,
     you find the country godforsaken;
     you gave me such a shocking fright!
     you help him to an honoured fate
     you in my arms on gingerbread?''
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     you know I'm hard to comprehend...
     you learn life's sweetness, and with this
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you'll never leave me to my fate.
     you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
     you'll recognize him soon enough, --
     you loved the opulent contact
     you made me drunk as one could ask!
     you newborn work, and like a winner

     young poet, be for ever blest!''
     young traitresses by the platoon,
     you object of my guileless ditties!
     your Tanya's image in your mind,
     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band

     you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
     you're sure to find her portrait in it:
     your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
     your grief would fail to touch my heart,
     your heart some self-restraint; for each
     your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
     your heroes, raging and ferocious,
     your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
     your loved one, honourable reader!
     your matchlessness, to seek to capture
     your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
     your night of fretting's left no trace!
     your presence aches, and in my blood!
     your pride, some answer, or in truth
     yourself too long from social life.''
     your soul displays, in holy dreams,
     your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
     your words, and in my soul to explore
     you see the two in uniform...
     you see, with tears and incantation
     you see your fated tempter stand.
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     youthful, who ripened in his time,
     youth is a fever; we must spare
     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
     youth which has nothing to regret,
     you too have seen on Neva's brink.
     you took an honourable part --
     you've made so many secret rhymes,
     you've paid insanity its due.
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     you won't find that quite so much catch...

     can disavow that. I have read
(Nabokov). While still at the Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo, in 1815, Pushkin read
     which with a blush he leaves unread.
     on which a carpet has been spread,
     before the fire a table's spread;
     but Olga would have never read!
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.

     others will follow where they tread...

     his transports, and the marriage-bed
     and doctors, he'd have died in bed.
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,

     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     for hours alone; she walked and walked...
     her way; she passed, then as she walked
     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
     monsters the maiden stood revealed.
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,
     but no, my Moscow never stumbled
     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     The lady of the house has fled.

     in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
     Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
     ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
     he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
     foes, friends and loves, their voice is stilled.

     Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     hymnal as, endlessly unfurled,
     he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
     could it be she... or had he dreamed?
     but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...
     the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened

     no notice of them. But I've chattered

     reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     that not a syllable be uttered
     in these last years all mixed and fluttered.
     The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
     they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
     I don't mean that she never shivered,
     no, even her eyebrow never quivered,
     our lives were flat, and what had fired
     he almost lost his mind, expired,
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;

     Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred

     no sound by which her soul is stirred.
     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     it was that he'd been truly stirred,
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     that sat above the stove and purred
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     she brought her talents, never ceased,
     Like convicts in a dream released

     Where is the fire that once ignited,

     his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     Sometimes a landscape's represented,
     she grew accustomed, and contented.
     in tears and violent tossing vented
     our disposition being invented
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
     Lensky of course was quite untainted
     instead the chance to get acquainted
     his mind's eye focused on the hinted
     Between the lines of text as printed,
     the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
     the downy woods are greener-tinted;
     Since earliest boyhood he had doted
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     But it was passion that preempted
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     to the hero that she'd adopted.
     she sighed, and in a trance coopted
     a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
     ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
     Outside the gate Tatyana parted
     sadly he mourned for the departed.
     treaties of nations long departed,
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     Between them, every topic started
     at earliest morning out she started,
     Eugene would willingly have started
     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     Now for the first time she's escorted
     Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
     of this our novel we reported,
     jealously, shyly, I've imported
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     but, without asking, they transported
     She was like him and always sported
     a hundred times afresh distorted;
     And long, as if through mists that spurted,
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     he found too much that he regretted:
     With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
     forehead, he strummed, his vision flitted
     before the clavichord with knitted
     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     by heaven with such an unsubdued
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     had long been wasting and enslaved
     by pain and languishment; she craved
     for maybe fortune will have saved
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     sweet old tradition was preserved:
     Russian pancakes were always served;
     conclude that it's high time she wed!...
     paterfamilias (unwed),
     perhaps for fame, he was endowed;
     and blood had bubbled as it flowed;
     and hope and passion; life had glowed
     and happy licence are allowed,
     by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,

     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     and soon will day's bright tune be played;
     or Freisch√ºtz as it might be played
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     of house-familiars stands dismayed...
     and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed
     while she's from top to toe surveyed;
     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     the man she feared and idolized --
     among the guests she recognized
     the lucky bard, and as he dozed

     So my Zaretsky, as I said,
     was the first thing that Olga said.
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     his awkwardness, he's hardly said
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     but at the window, in the splendid

     fancy, a wine serene in mood,
     with Eugene frozen where he stood.
     below a hill; a garden stood
     there's not a word she's understood;

     and trails alone around the wood.''
     by the new whisper in the wood?
     Buy√°nov's heels have split the wood

     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     out of the hand of that same bard:
     of Gulnare, he would play a card
     but in the old days she had heard
     or worse, to a soir√©e. Unheard
     How could she? why, he'd never heard...

     from the first moment it was heard
     the source's chattering voice is heard;

     and always the inspired regard --
     with puzzled and confused regard...
     on jam, and speeches in regard
     Tatyana lowered her regard
     and tears were drowning her regard.
     Olga's no life in her regard:
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     as at a censure that was hard.
     in deepest thought at the chess-board

     acute and subtle -- in a word

     I really dote upon the word:
     Arrived apace, he gives the word
     No, she's already pledged her word
     to Eugene's letter, word for word.
     of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,
     and there a tombstone says its word
     and washed its face, to her brought word
     all that today we find absurd.

     might have resounded long and loud
     Melpomene wails long and loud,
     as much as in Moscow the proud.
     my giddy mistress made me proud.
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     among my friends, in all that crowd

     fresh as a poppy-flower, your face.''

     just now of wrestling with his shade,
     into the tomb's mysterious shade;
     with mournful sound the secret shade

     and plunged in tender shame's confusion,
     an idle monk in glum seclusion,
     The manor house, in deep seclusion,
     I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     dear Tanya, lover of illusion;
     What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
     He followed them without illusion,

     screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
     lost them without regret's contusion,

     at verse, and hiss an imprecation,
     Idle again by dedication,
     O Adrian waves, my invocation;
     and all our modish education;
     it mastered him in slow gradation;
     Tatyana sees with trepidation
     etcetera. But her trepidation
     Seeing herself as a creation --
     the millions of two-legged creation
     of Eugene, cold as all creation,
     have you read lines of your creation
     the fleeting works of my creation,

     rebuffed, found instant consolation;
     that corps of social legislation --
     a hideous deal of tribulation.
     so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
     This wearisome perambulation
     in time (to quote the calculation
     alone, and sunk in calculation,
     Compliment and congratulation;
     But here, with our congratulation

     come, trouble my imagination,
     thank God, he had no inclination
     yet a capricious inclination,
     too long, against my inclination,
     Sign of the urge for domination:
     And home was now their destination;
     the coach has reached its destination;
     I'm altering my destination
     She struck one as the incarnation --
     I know (and seek your exculpation)
     but the salon's preoccupation
     Even at home his occupation
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     Tatyana's name day celebration.
     would have been spared this laceration.
     Bards of our tearful generation,
     where are distress, commiseration?
     by writers of her admiration,
     when our sublimest aspiration,
     Napoleon's our sole inspiration;
     where dwelt this child of inspiration,
     Fired by the god of inspiration,
     ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
     hear, once more filled with inspiration,
     field-work, and walks with inspiration,
     But come, thou youthful inspiration,
     A moment earlier, inspiration
     bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,
     of his Och√°kov7 decoration!
     with careful schemes of decoration
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     Though belles had lost his adoration,
     When progress and amelioration
     She enjoys the stately orchestration
     with a blunt cue for the duration,
     and in the misted condensation
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     it had no sparkle of sensation,
     Then gradually upon sensation,
     and logic; yet the conversation
     To talk, to general conversation
     this was our heroes' conversation
     (I like a friendly conversation,
     no mannerism, no affectation,
     Left-handed from the habitation
     the strangeness of her habitation,
     Lost in our backwoods habitation
     In time, who knows, the agitation
     trusted her without hesitation,
     ``I?'' ``Saturday. The invitation
     another bard1 in exaltation
     you see, with tears and incantation
     So to his wife for presentation
     where fate had fixed our confrontation,
     Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
     thrives to this moment, in a station
     mother implored me; my sad station
     how soon the bounds of rank and station
     had filled this heart, and detestation
     must be to hold in detestation
     before the window taking station,
     With mounts from home, or postal station,
     < My gaze pursues them... but on station
     is where old master took up station,
     And from the nearby Army station
     The invalid's glad salutation,
     When Eugene's turn for salutation
     on words of foreign derivation,
     finding in that no deprivation --
     I pray God grant his soul salvation,
     what kind of thought, what observation,
     I thank him without reservation,
     Tatyana listened with vexation
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     of his intent; and a reaction
     of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
     for nature's unadorned reaction
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     the quintessential reaction
     by what's called machinal reaction,
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
     A pause of silence and inaction,
     of Russian verse, its force in action, --
     she can't make out a single fraction
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     present her languor and distraction
     Lensky all evening, in distraction,
     had long proved tedious to distraction:
     what dream accounts for her distraction?
     Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
     Tatyana never knew the attraction
     It's true, the magnet-like attraction
     But you perhaps find no attraction
     In time past, objects of affection
     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     I feel a brotherly affection,
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     Whatever in this rough confection
     worthier of you in the perfection
     showed one a pattern of perfection
     the universe is all perfection;
     arrested by the sheer perfection
     and always the self-same objection;
     on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
     for him all sham has found rejection,
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,
     and charming reverie's vain deflection
     the man of reverie and reflection,
     what holds her in profound reflection,
     in simple but sublime reflection,
     is lost in obstinate reflection;
     almanacs, journals of reflection,
     a dream's mute monument, reflection
     Lending his tone a grave inflection,
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     what held me was my predilection,
     To reading from this odd collection
     But, as it is, this pied collection
     He found them in some old collection,
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     absorbed me in the recollection
     Another page of recollection:
     then on the leaves of recollection,
     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     but groomed an anecdote-collection
     Poets, I'll say in this connection,
     the books then underwent inspection...
     Walking her horse in introspection
     but looks and talk took the direction,
     Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...
     I trust my fate to your direction,
     all brought to life at your direction.
     Reader, whatever fate's direction,
     She wanders on without direction.

     I've learnt the voice of new ambition,

     he changed the corv√©e of tradition
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     the unmetric verses of tradition
     only by rule, and strict tradition

     Protect me from such apparition
     what is he? Just an apparition,
     was it not you, dear apparition,
     I'm blind to every apparition;
     a truly noble disposition;
     methodical by disposition,
     ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''
     the first will never find fruition,
     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     Vladimir to this casual mention
     and so he lacks the strength to mention
     and then it's tea that comes to mention,
     it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
     but I've not got the least intention
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     What cause has won me your attention?
     her husband's or the world's attention...
     Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     Now, she devours, with what attention,

     and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
     he'll charm you with his fine invention,

     Zaretsky draws up a convention
     Could it not be that by convention

     Deaf to her sister's intervention,

     our hapless Tanya! An emotion
     Tatyana in a deep emotion
     your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
     What sort of roses, in your notion,
     she drinks it like a priceless potion;
     of wild repentance and devotion
     Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
     By dreams now sad in their conception,
     More tolerant in his conception

     Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
     still eats and drinks enough for two.

     ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:
     is deep in love, just like a boy;
     reluctant to exhaust the boy,
     ``he dandled me as a small boy.
     lately he married off his boy.''
     on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:
     treated his lessons as a ploy.
     brooding that is the lover's ploy.
     How many times I made a toy
     never come and like a spy
     spends light and darkness in the dreary
     on features known, but to that dreary,
     across to her consort a weary
     bored with hilarity, and weary,
     Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
     The two old ladies kiss and cry;
     in unison repeat the cry:
     but Tanya found she couldn't cry:
     all egoistical and dry,
     in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:
     Alas, Eugene beyond all query
     How long he'd been here, was her query,
     have your fill of revelry!
     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
     fortune, and dignity, and glory,
     ``as sung of old, in years of glory,
     and leave no faint footprint of glory...
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     ``To me, Onegin, all this glory

     once more Corneille's majestic story;
     at fifty, would prolong the story
     this modish whirl, this social story,
     to high renown my doleful story,
     Only the ode, that solemn story!
     Right at the outset of my story
     But onward, onward with my story!
     That isn't our immediate worry:
     Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
     with perturbation and with worry;
     He rings at once, and what a scurry!
     she can't; and in her panic hurry
     and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
     with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     boredom has just as sure an entry,

     Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
     for in our time, beyond dubiety,
     Capricious belles of grand Society!

     But, did they not corrupt society,
     Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
     another's grin was sly and shifty,
     But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
     But then, oblivious of the city,

     of old-lime hospitality.
     in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
     the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
     go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     is this -- one sees from here the party:
     devote to whist an evening party,
     a ball here, there a children's party;
     You'd never class her as a beauty;
     Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
     and look serenely on your beauty!...
     I've known too many a haughty beauty,
     what London calls, with humble duty
     inexorably wed to duty,
     All flourishing; they send their duty.
     meanwhile with a dissembler's duty
